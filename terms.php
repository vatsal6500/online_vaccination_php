     <ul style="font-size: 20px;"><li>Some parents may hesitate to have their kids vaccinated. They have questions or worry that a child might have a serious reaction or get the illness the vaccine prevents. But the components of vaccines are weakened or killed. In some cases, only parts of the germ are used. So they're unlikely to cause any serious illness.</li>
     	<br>

      <li>Some vaccines may cause mild reactions, such as soreness where the shot was given or a fever. But serious reactions are rare. The risks of vaccinations are small compared with the health risks of the diseases they're intended to prevent.</li><br>

       <li>Immunizations are one of the best means of protection against contagious diseases.</li></ul><br>

     <ul style="font-size: 20px;"><li>abies are born with protection against some diseases because their mothers pass antibodies (proteins made by the body to fight disease) to them before birth. Breastfed babies continue to get more antibodies in breast milk. But in both cases, the protection is temporary.</li><br>

    <li> Immunization (vaccination) is a way to create immunity to (protection from) some diseases. This is done by using small amounts of a killed or weakened germ that causes the disease.</li><br>

      <li>Germs can be viruses (such as the measles virus) or bacteria (such as pneumococcus). Vaccines stimulate the immune system to react as if there were a real infection. It fends off the "infection" and remembers the germ. Then, it can fight the germ if it enters the body later.</li><br>

       <center><h1 style="font-size:30px; ">Side effect</h1></center><br>
      <li>Most side effects from vaccines are minor and easily treated. The most common are pain , redness, and swelling at the injection site. Some children may also develop a fever or a rash. Rarely, vaccines may cause severe allergic reactions, swelling of the brain, or seizures. Unusual reaction after receiving a vaccine should be reported to the doctor right away.</li></ul></b>
